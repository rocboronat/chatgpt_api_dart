## Getting started

Register for API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api). 

## Installation

This package is hosted in [Pub Dev Library](https://pub.dev/packages/chatgpt_client)

### Flutter App

```dart
flutter pub add chatgpt_client
```

### Dart App
```dart
dart pub add chatgpt_client
```

## Usage

### Initialization

Initialize with api key. Default model is `gpt-3.5-turbo`.

```dart
import 'package:chatgpt_client/chatgpt_client.dart';

const client = ChatGPTClient(apiKey: "API_KEY");
```

optionally, you can provide the system prompt, temperature, and model like so.

```dart
const client = ChatGPTClient(apiKey: "API_KEY",
    model: "gpt-4",
    systemPrompt: "You are a CS Professor",
    temperature: 0.7);
```

There are 2 APIs: stream and normal

### Stream Response

The server will yield chunks of data until the stream completes or throws an error.

```dart
try {
    var text = "";
    final stream = client.sendMessageStream(prompt);
    await for (final textChunk in stream) {
        text += textChunk;
        print(textChunk);
    }
    print(text);
} catch (exception) {
    print(exception.toString());
}
```

### Normal
A normal HTTP request and response lifecycle. Server will send the complete text (it will take more time to response)

```dart
try {
    final text = await client.sendMessage(prompt);
    print(text);
} catch (exception) {
    print(exception.toString());
}   
```

## History List

The client stores the history list of the conversation that will be included in the new prompt so ChatGPT aware of the previous context of conversation. When sending new prompt, the client will make sure the token is not exceeding 4000 (using calculation of 1 token=4chars), in case it exceeded the token, some of previous conversations will be truncated

You can also delete the history list by invoking

```dart
client.clearHistoryList();
```
